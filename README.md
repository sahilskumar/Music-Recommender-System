## Text Similarity Using Siamese Deep Neural Network

Siamese neural network is a class of **neural network architectures that contain two or more** **identical** **subnetworks**. *identical* here means they have the same configuration with the same parameters 
and weights. Parameter updating is mirrored across both subnetworks.

It is a keras based implementation of deep siamese Bidirectional LSTM network to capture phrase/sentence similarity using word embeddings.

Below is the architecture description for the same.
